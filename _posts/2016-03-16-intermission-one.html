I did it. I passed all assignments in module one. This comes as a surprise, actually. All the way through the last six weeks I was convinced
I would fail. Fail assessments, fail projects, just not be able to keep up.<br>
And as for many other students at Turing School it is a new experience for me to not succeed easily, to not be good at the new subject of learning,
to not be at least in the group of the average performers.<br>
It is also this experience that makes Turing School such a big learning ground. There is the chance to learn how to deal with failure in a pretty safe environment.
To constructively work with failure is one of the many softskills that we all need not just as coders but generally in life. Failure shows us where we need to adjust or learn more.
Nothing else. <br> It doesn't say anything about who we are, if we are a good or a bad person, if we are a successful person or not. <br>
It simply shows us, that this specific reaction or attempt of a solution to a problem didn't work and we need to look for a different one.<br>
Doesn't feel this easy when I am nervous before a test or an evaluation. But being part of a group where many have a similar experience
makes it so much easier to shift the focus and take it less personal. Then the adrenaline levels go down and I can actually perform better
and even pass the module at the end of the day. Sweet.<br>
This first module has been such an incredible experience for me on so many levels. I have learned SOOO much new stuff, I am able to use my brain in a new way, I have discovered my love for coding,
I have met so many incredible people. <br>
I am still tired, trying to catch up with sleep. But I am eager and excited to move to the next module to learn a whole lot more.
