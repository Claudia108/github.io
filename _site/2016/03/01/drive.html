<h1>What Drives Me</h1>
<p id="date">March 01, 2016</p>
<p>
It is an interesting assignment to reflect on this topic. What drives me? When am I in the flow? What keeps me in the moment 100%? <br>
Well, my most unconscious flow happens when I get to try out things, when I can explore but also have a clear goal and timeline
for the outcome. I forget about time and space, I am fully engaged, in the moment. I feel my capacities grow. <br>
The rewards comes from these incredibly joyful aha-moments where things suddenly make sense, when I learn. These moments have such power
that all the sometimes painful hours of trying to get there don't matter anymore. <br>
Speaking of weaknesses and dangers of that state: It is easy to forget body needs, needs of others around, other responsibilities.
Not so easy to pull myself out of a rewarding flow.
<br>
Turing School shows many aspects of what I consider a rewarding worklife. I chose this career
because I love to be creative and because I get the sense that the industry of sofware development is more supportive of
structures that generate creative states of work for me: more flexibility in working hours, interesting projects, teamwork, constant learning on the job,
solving problems for things that make the world a better place. <br>
Coming to school I put all the energy in getting a step closer to that goal, learning as much as possible as fast as possible,
to become more and more part of this great community.<br>
What makes my motivation dissolve? I get frustrated and tired when I feel locked in in tight outer structures, when I have to blindly follow instructions
I don't understand or agree with at all, when I feel overwhelmed and don't have access to the right tools to solve the problems laying ahead. <br>
Reasons to make me feel ok about a failure can be manifold: if the work load is just way too much, if I am sick,
if the outer structures aren't supportive of the project I am working on and I can't be at my best.<br>
I am doing my best work if I have clear instructions with a timeline, if I can and need to be creative to figure out things
and have tools to move along, and especially if I can work with other people and be part of a learning community.
