<h1>Taming the Beast - My First Steps at Turing School</h1>
<p id="date">February 15, 2016</p>
<p>
The assignment in the beginning of week 2 in module 1 was to create a linked list. <br>
We spent quite a bit of time in class to explore the concept of it: a linked list is made of nodes. Each node
is made of data and the link to the next node. The first node is the head, the last one the tail.
Every node only knows about the next node - not about any other nodes or the whole list.
We even went upstairs to the foyer for an exercise of a linked list of people.<br>
And it all made sense. Yes, I felt I totally understood the concept - until I sat down and tried to translate it into Ruby code.
At that moment I went blank, totally, for two whole days. Up to the end of class the day before evaluation I did not know
how to even begin and was absolutely convinced that I would misearably fail this project.<br>
Then I finally asked for help. Thanks to this wonderful community here at Turing and all the patient fellow students and staff
things slowly started to make sense.<br>
One moment stands out to me: How do you move through a linked list to get to the end? Well,
you start out at the head and iterate through it, but how? The current node has to somehow become the next node.
You just assign it that way inside a loop. Simple, right? <br>Yes, now I can see it. But it took so much and so long to understand
this to get to this simple looping:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="code-example">
while current_node.link<br>
current_node = current_node.link<br>
end</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>It is hard to express the satisfaction and joy I felt when it finally clicked. I was euphoric and so full of energy that I just kept working into the night and actually managed to finish the whole project in time - again with a lot of patient help from the people around. People, who take the time to actually walk you through the thinking process behind the code rather than showing you what they wrote or what you should write.<br>
<br>
I started Turing School with a big question mark in my mind. I didn't have any experience with coding before and had no idea if I would even like that kind of work. This project showed me that I do really like this playful and mind-boggling process. It helped me to trust my capacity to learn this new way of thinking more and it showed me some of the great qualities of this amazing community.
Facit: It is fun to tame the beast!</p>
